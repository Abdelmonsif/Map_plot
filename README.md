# Map_plot
Plotting RNAseq and polysome associated seq and CLIP seq

A python script to easily plot the fold change of three different next generation sequencing datasets

mRNA abundanance fold change (RNAseq)
mRNA translation efficiency (polysome associated seq)
mRNA binding to a specific protein (CLIP seq)

# Usage:
python map_plot.py -RPKM_file RPKM_normalized_all_filtered -output sora
